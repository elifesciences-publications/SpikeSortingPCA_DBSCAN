# SpikeSortingPCA_DBSCAN
Spike sorting implemented with principal component analysis (PCA) and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) for extracellular differential electrode recordings. The primary functionality of this software package is for analyzing mechanical stimulation experiments, but it can be adapted for any type of experimental protocol.

IMPORTANT: Tested on Matlab R2017b

IMPORTANT: The following Matlab Toolboxes are required:

Bioinformatics Toolbox, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, Signal Processing Toolbox, Curve Fitting Toolbox,



## The software is designed to handle raw data formats exported to Matlab from Labchart software.

IMPORTANT: Currently only supports data aquired with a 20 kHz sampling rate.

IMPORTANT: Export data in the following order: Raw trace, Force Trace, Displacement Trace.

IMPORTANT: Select demo based on indenter used (GerlingIndenter, AuroraIndenter)


## Demos are provided for each indenter (Aurora Indenter or Gerling Indenter):

### AURORA INDENTER

1) Spike_Sort_Demo_Aurora # Start here. This demo takes you through raw data processing, spike sorting, and data analysis

    - Try with GerlingIndenter Demo Data. Process each trial data individually, then combine in the below 'Trial Averaging Demo'
        
    - To load data simply load Demo Data into Matlab workspace. The variable with raw data is called "data".

2) Trial Averaging Demos (2 implemented for Aurora):

    - TrialAveraging_Demo_DynamicStatic_Aurora # Use this demo next if you want to compare Dynamic and Static Firing Rates (skip if not)
    
    - TrialAveraging_Demo_meanFiringRate_Aurora # Use this demo instead if you want to analyze Mean Firing Rate (skip if not)

3) SummaryFigureDemo_ForAurora # Use this demo to make a figure quality summary figure

### GERLING INDENTER

1) Spike_Sort_Demo_GerlingIndenter # Start here. This demo takes you through raw data processing, spike sorting, and data analysis

    - Try with GerlingIndenter Demo Data. Process each trial data individually, then combine in the below 'Trial Averaging Demo'
        
    - To load data simply load Demo Data into Matlab workspace. The variable with raw data is called "data".

2) TrialAveraging_Demo_4PLfit_GerlingIndenter # Use this demo next if you want to compare Dynamic and Static Firing Rates

3) Summary_Figure_Demo_GerlingIndenter # Use this demo to make a figure quality summary figure
